# MultiKeyMap C# Implementation #

C# implementation of the multi-key map.  It behaves like a regular generic IDictionary with the additional ability of getting its values by any combination of partial keys. For example, one can add any value with the complex key {"Hello", "the", "wonderful", "World!"} , and then query by any sequence of subkeys like {"wonderful", "Hello"}.
